## Blackjack

###### Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework

### Intro

This project is the basic gameplay of blackjack.  It uses classes to create a functional command line blackjack game.  Blackjack uses the concept of objects oriented programming in order to piece together all the components necessary in order to have a functional program.  Blackjack works on writing methods, using conditionals to create game logic, use collection types to organize and manage data, and builds classes whose fields are objects.

### Technologies Used

* Java
* Objects
* Methods
* Conditionals

#### Lessons Learned

Blackjack was a good project for piecing how everything we have been learning comes together.  From using several classes from being abstract to using constructors, fields, and objects to be able to have everything functioning together properly.  Unfortunately I took a pernicious path down originally in the game app and spent a plethora of time trying to piece together poor logic.  Although it seems like wasted time, the struggle throughout seems to have provided more exposures to many different aspects making things more clear.  Pushing forward, this was a good project and there is much more i wish i could have done with it, had not been so busy burning time on the minutia of things.
